Personal Website by Arvin Mark Atienza - calling my online persona as a3140.

The concept is that from Ideas, to bits, we can make changes into the real world through the technology that we use.

Reiterating this website over and over and I started this to be the simplest form and then continuously integrate features, pages, and improvements over time.

I used a
`Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite` template for this project as it made the initial setup easier.
